# Ultra Simple Calculator

The project use python as a programing language and for GUI we used Tkinter.

Traditional programming and codes are not for user when we have to give any project to any user, generally the user requirment is clean, non coding, button and 
useful text environment.

Mainly after doing many project on tkinter in windows when i first tried in OSx i faced many issue regarding with button color, insert etc. From this project i get 
to know more about how a to handle grid,to work on Entry and how to use any function.
